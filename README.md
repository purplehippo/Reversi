# Reversi
A proof of concept game of Othello (aka Reversi), built using MVC5, SignalR, AngularJS, Bootstrap, etc

This project was designed to gain an initial and working understanding of MVC(5) and SignalR.  Once that was successfully working, Bootstrap CSS and AngularJS was added, replacing jQuery and the original design.

There are many things that could be improved, for example:
  I have struggled to get 'the right' interpretation of front end (AngularJS/jQuery) vs back end code.  My experience is separating concerns from HTML, but AngularJS introduces it back in to JavaScript, and the line appears fuzzy.
  AngularJS appears to supercede much of the MVC design principles.
  It is not obvious how 'Model' (from MVC) backend code fits with dependencies, such as Interfaces and Abstract classes.

With this in mind, I have a working solution which demonstrates an understanding, and an ability to learn and implement, a number of web technologies without specific previous experience in any, and over just a few days.
